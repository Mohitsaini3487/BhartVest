/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for BharatVest application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user has exclusive access to their profile and work history.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId} or keyed by userId, ensuring that each user's data is isolated.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed.
 * - Read-only collections are not present in this model.
 * - Ambiguous relationships default to owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data model is designed to achieve authorization independence. All data necessary to authorize a request is available within the document being accessed or its direct path. This avoids costly and complex `get()` operations in the rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The use of user-specific subcollections and paths ensures that private data remains isolated and simplifies access control.
